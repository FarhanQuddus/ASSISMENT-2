     <p>
        Web development is the process of developing websites or web applications that run on the Internet (or an Intranet). It can take various forms, including database management, web programming, and web design, among others.
        Web development can be a daunting task for non-technical users, but now, there are tools such as website builders available to all. These are made especially for those without any experience with web programming. These kinds of tools are typically aimed at startups or small companies.
